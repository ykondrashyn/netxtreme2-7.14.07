       Cause: Creating static NPIV ports before thei FcoE interface was enabled confused fcoe-utils and caused the FCoE interface to not be enabled. 
       Change: Move static NPIV creation to after the FCoE interface is enabled. 
       Impact: ALL 

    2. Problem: Cont00080433 - Double Entries FCoE interfaces in RH6.7 with v2.9.4 
       Cause: If the first static NPIV table entry had 0 for the WWNN and the WWPN we would still create a phantom FCoE interface.

       Impact:  All

    2. Problem: Cont00075926 - Linux systems fail to PLOGI storage during VC module reboot test 
       Cause:   HP VC sends a broadcast frame to the initiator that is the same OX_ID as the outstanding FIP FLOGI to the FCF which causes us to interpret a bad frame.
       Change:  Drop FCoE frames until Linux has established a login with the FCF
       Impact:  All

    1. Problem: Cont00075927 - Linux systems fail to log back into XP array when LOGO returned after PLOGI 
       Cause:   Linux fires a PLOGI immediately after the XP returns a LOGO which causes a PLOGI flood
       Change:  Add a 500 millisecond delay after processing the LOGO before retrying the PLOGI
       Impact:  All

================
    1. Problem: Cont00075785 - EMC VPLEX LUN unreachable through Broadcom 57810-k over FCoE in ESX 5.5. 
       Cause:   The driver is passing up FCP_RESID when it shouldn't be because neither the underrun or overrun bits are set in the FCP_RSP. 
       Change:  The driver has been modified to pass on the FCP_RESID to the SCSI mid-layer only when the underrun or overrun flag is set.
       Impact:  All

    2. Problem: Cont00074930 - 630M intermittently fails to PRLI after PLOGI on SLES 11 SP3 
       Cause:   When dev_loss_tmo expires it closes any open exchanges which can include port login commands such as PLOGI.
       Change:  Flush the dev_loss_tmo work when the driver receives the netdev change event for link to prevent the race condition. 
       Impact:  All

================
    1. Problem: Cont00072103 - system hangs when destroying FCoE initiators by
                unloading bnx2x
       Cause:   The fix for Cont71562 has created this problem for older distros
                which still uses the old FCoE sysfs structure
       Change:  Removed the flush workqueue fix for older distros
       Impact:  All


Version 2.4.2b (Nov 15, 2013):
=============================
Internal Release:
RHEL Kernel		: RHEL 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 7.0
SLES Kernel		: SLES 11 SP2, SP3
Firmware Version        : 7.10.2

Fixes & Features
================
    1. Problem: Cont00071765 - Does not compile against RHEL7.0
       Cause:   The Makefile does not have RHEL7.0 support
       Change:  Added support
       Impact:  All

    2. Problem: Cont00070101 - FC-TAPE Host response early to a requested
                resend delay
       Cause:   The retry delay was not supported
       Change:  Added support by returning TARGET_BUSY to the SCSI ML
                for the corresponding LUN until the retry timer expires
       Impact:  All

    3. Problem: Cont00071562 - Show "BUG: soft lockup" when unloading bnx2x
       Cause:   The 3.10 kernel has a change in the scsi removal path where
                the netdev device must not be removed before the rport removal
       Change:  Ensure all destroy work has been completed prior to the
                netdev removal
       Impact:  All


Version 2.4.1e (Oct 30, 2013):
=============================
Internal Release:
RHEL Kernel		: RHEL 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
SLES Kernel		: SLES 11 SP2, SP3
Firmware Version        : 7.8.52

Fixes & Features
================
    1. Problem: Cont00071596 - RHEL6.5ss4 - System hang, then reboot when
                connecting to FCoE targets
       Cause:   Between RHEL6.5ss3 and ss4, the fcoe_ctlr_to_ctlr_dev macro
                in the libfcoe has been augmented to use the ctlr->cdev ptr
                instead
       Change:  Added code to adapt to this patch
       Impact:  RHEL6.5


Version 2.4.1d (Oct 09, 2013):
=============================
Internal Release:
RHEL Kernel		: RHEL 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
SLES Kernel		: SLES 11 SP2, SP3
Firmware Version        : 7.8.52

Fixes & Features
================
    1. Problem: Cont00071262 - Unable to boot to system when installing with
                BFS + DUD update + Anaconda patch for RHEL6.5ss1
       Cause:   The FCoE interface sysfs has been moved under RHEL6.5 and
                upstream
       Change:  Added code to move the interface sysfs location for RHEL6.5
       Impact:  RHEL6.5


Version 2.4.1c (Sep 26, 2013):
=============================
Internal Release:
RHEL Kernel		: RHEL 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
SLES Kernel		: SLES 11 SP2, SP3
Firmware Version        : 7.8.52

Fixes & Features
================
    1. Problem: Cont00071138 - Changing MTU causes FCoE interface to remain
                linkdown
       Cause:   The previous rmmod fix has added a redundant setting of the
                interface->enabled to false in the stop routine which prevented
                the FCoE ctlr link from being brought back up upon netevent UP           
       Change:  Removed this setting in the stop routine
       Impact:  All

    2. Problem: Cont00071154 - RHEL6.5 System panics on creating FCoE interface
       Cause:   The RHEL6.5 kernel introduced a new fc_disc_config routine to
                configure the lport for FC discovery which was not being called
       Change:  Added the call to this fc_disc_config routine upon FC init
       Impact:  All

=============================
Internal Release:
RHEL Kernel		: RHEL 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
SLES Kernel		: SLES 11 SP2, SP3
Firmware Version        : 7.8.51

Fixes & Features
================
    1. Problem: Cont00070975 - bnx2fc does not compile in RHEL6.5 alpha1
       Cause:   bnx2fc needs to be updated to work with the libfc/libfcoe that
                is running in RHEL6.5
       Change:  Added the changes to support RHEL6.5
       Impact:  All

    2. Problem: Cont00070958 - Call trace and system instability when unloading
                bnx2x modules
       Cause:   A rtnl_lock deadlock was observed in the rmmod bnx2x path when it
                tries to flush fcoemon's sysfs write of the store_ctlr_enabled control
                param to disable the interface
       Change:  Fixed this disabling path to skip the unnecessary locking
       Impact:  RHEL6.5+

=============================
Internal Release:
RHEL Kernel		: RHEL 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
SLES Kernel		: SLES 11 SP2, SP3
Firmware Version        : 7.8.51

Fixes & Features
================
    1. Problem: FCoE offload does not function
       Cause:   The doorbell formula has been changed in bnx2x-1.78.52 due
                to VF RSS
       Change:  Added corresponding doorbell change
       Impact:  All

    2. Problem: Cont00070728 - SLES11SP2 MEZ75 IO halt with Nexus reboot tests
       Cause:   A race condition was found between bnx2fc's io timeout handler
                and the scsi layer's task abort request
       Change:  Added BNX2FC_FLAG_IO_CLEANUP flag to arbitrate between the two paths
       Impact:  All

Version 0.2.0 (Jan 19, 2010):
=============================

Internal Release:
Kernel Version: 2.6.32 (fcoe-next)

Installation Instructions:
==========================
1. Install the kernel

	rpm -ivh kernel-2.6.32.fcoe.next-5.bcm.x86_64.rpm

2. Install bnx2fc/cnic/bnx2x drivers
	
	rpm -Uvh bnx2fc-0.2.0-3.bcm.x86_64.rpm
	rpm -Uvh bnx2fc-debuginfo-0.2.0-3.bcm.x86_64.rpm

3. Edit /boog/grub/menu.lst to make this as a default kernel  OR
   Select this kernel in the boot menu while the system is booting up

4. reboot

5. Start vlan interface

	ifconfig ethX mtu 2300 up
	modprobe 8021q
	vconfig add ethX <vlan_id>
	ifconfig ethX.<vlan_id> up

   ethX is the ethernet interface connected to the FCF.

6. modprobe bnx2fc <vlan_id>  [default is 4]

[NOTE] 1. If bnx2fc rpm fails to install due to conflict with previosly installed
       bnx2x driver, remove it by running 'rpm -e bnx2x'

       2. If bnx2x driver fails to load due to dependency with crc32c, manually run
	- modprobe crc32c
	- modprobe bnx2x
       3. If there is a firmware loading error during system boot up after installing
          the kernel and bnx2fc drivers, install the firmware rpm as well.
	rpm -Uvh kernel-firmware-2.6.32.fcoe.next-5.bcm.x85_64.rpm

Current Limitations:
====================
1. No PFC/DCBx
2. Upstread Only Release (This is not the driver that can be directly installable on RHEL5.4 kernel)

Debug Data to collect in case of failure:
=========================================
1. syslog (/var/log/messages)
2. uname -a output
3. grcDump (for FW asserts)
